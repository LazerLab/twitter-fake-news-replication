100percentfedup.com	Red	Red		Red	The site publishes major falsehood to advance their political agenda with little regard for the facts.

ahtribune.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	Mostly factual reporting combined with sensationalism. Several major distortions led to the classification of Orange.

allenbwest.com	Red	Red		Red	Allen West is a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives. However, his site is full of scare mongering (e.g. "You haven't heard the SCARIEST thing about today's eclipse"), and partisan clickbait (e.g. What 'Mad Dog' Mattis just told sailers is causing a feminist MELTDOWN."). After examining 4 additional majorly false stories from this site in Snopes (see below) we find it as having little regard for the truth: http://www.snopes.com/ford-motors-funds-black-lives-matter/, http://www.snopes.com/2016/08/08/michael-phelps-wasnt-forced-out-of-flag-bearer-role-in-rio/, http://www.snopes.com/john-kerry-iranian-son-law/, http://www.snopes.com/2015/06/29/allen-west-gay-marriage/	2
amazon.com	Green	Green		Green	Not a news site, e-commerce.	2
americannews.com	Red	Red		Red	Multiple incidents of fabricated and/or severly distorted stories. Almost every article is clickbait (Example article titles "Antifa attacks a jail, then does something that ought to concern every american", "CNN anchor makes scandalour claim...", "Coup inside white house started to remove Trump...The leader's identity will shock you".)	3
americantoday.news	Red	Red		Red	Major falsehoods, combined with hyper-partisan world view that's bordering conspiracy with little regard for the truth. Clickbait (Example article title: "Senator who called for Trump's  assassination just did something no-one expected!") and conspiratorial articles "Clinton Foundation Shipping Manifest Proves DEADLY Conspiracy Against Trump"	1

awm.com	Yellow	Yellow		Yellow	Mostly opinion based, but a few inaccuracies (e.g. "People All Over Are Putting Butter In Their Coffee, Here’s How It Can Actually Save Your Life" ). Clickbait site that covers "shocking" stories with some conservative tilt, but the facts are not severe distorted.	2
babylonbee.com	Satire	Satire		Satire	This Christian satire site has mostly benign articles (Example article title: "5 signs you might actually be a Russian spy", and "Feminist dismisses bible as Godsplaining".). The site states its satire nature at the end of every article. Articles seemed obviously satire, but can perhaps mislead people on rare occasions. We did not identify a clear political agenda behind it, thus will to code as yellow-satire.	1
barenakedislam.com	Red	Red		Red	This ant-islamic site subtitle reads "It isn't Islamophobia if they really are trying to kill you". Promotes islamophobia / hate towards Muslims through stories that have little or no evidence behind them.	2
bipartisanreport.com	Red	Orange		Red	Multiple incidents of fabricated and/or severly distorted stories. Headlines likes: "BREAKING: Donald Trump Ends Campaign By FULLY Blaming Jews For Downfall"	3
blakkpepper.com	Yellow	Orange		Yellow	Health section promotes many unscientific claims (Example article: limes can help diabetes, weight loss, respiratory disorders, arthritis, eye care, piles, cholera, gout, and more). However, the site is mostly not political. NOTE: Although articles are attributed to an author, they are all by "Eli".	1
breitbart.com	Yellow	Orange	Yellow	Yellow	The site publishes stories with strong partisan agenda, potentially tactically positioned to influence current political events. It gives the stage for extreme world views, but it does not distort the facts more than minor inaccuracies. 	3
buzzfeed.com	Green	Yellow		Green	Sober and sourced news reporting (aside from entertainment part). No evidence of false information being propogated. Low quality journalism with clickbait on the entertainment sections. (Example article title: "19 Food Pictures That Will Make You Feel Really Fucking Uncomfortable: You'll never be able to unsee these", and "33 worst TV boyfriends of all time".)	1
channel-7-news.com	Red	Orange		Red	The news on this site is from 2016, no updates to be seen. High partisan clickbait (e.g. "Obama's doctor: Hillary needs to have her head examined!"; "LEAKED: Take a peek inside the Clinton campaign’s “hospital on wheels”). Snopes recognizes it as fake news site. The article provided is a hoax. Together with the misleading domain name and the ceased coverage as off Sep 13, 2016, we believe this is a classical hoax/fake site.	1
cheezburger.com	Green	Yellow		Yellow	Memes and macros site. The little news they carry can be perceived as low quality journalism that is mostly opinion based e.g. "Parents share the weirdest things they caught their kids doing".	1
christiannews.net	Yellow	Orange		Yellow	Low quality journalism, mostly opinion based with some inaccuracies (Example article title:"Archaeologists Discover Road on Which Jesus Walked From Pool of Siloam to Temple").	1
collective-evolution.com	Red	Red		Red	Conspiracy theorizing. (Example article title: "Stunning UFO Sighting In Phoenix, Arizona Aug 18, 2017"). While none of the articles in snopes are political in nature, there is a strong consipiratorial thinking in their politics section and thus classified as Red. 	1
concealednation.org	Orange	Yellow		Orange	The site offers articles related to guns, concealed carry, and gun product reviews. Many of the breaking news are sensationalist and light on facts. Snopes captured one fabricated story, which leads us to classify as Orange 	2
conservativefiringline.com	Orange	Red		Red	Pro-gun site that contains heavily biased articles. (Example article title: "Alt-left in Austin admits goal is to destroy U.S., chants ‘Death to America’", "No such thing as ‘transgender’ – Says who? Science" )	1
conservativeoutfitters.com	Red	Yellow		Red	At first the site appears as a commerrce-first store, however it does carry a news section with an extremely biased right-wing agenda. The major falsehood documented by snopes as well as the stories archived from this site (http://archive.is/www.conservativeoutfitters.com) lead us to classify this site as mostly false. 	1
conservativepost.com	Red	Red		Red	Unscientific claims (Example article title: "WATCH: Scientific Proof That God is Protecting Israel") and sensationalism (Example article title: "BREAKING: Fox News Just Dropped An Absolutely Devastating Bomb On Democrats" and "Well, Well, Well – Bill Clinton Was Caught Defending the KKK, and Liberals Were Totally Cool With It") NOTE: Articles are attributed to initials.	1

crooksandliars.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	The site mixes truth and falsehoods for advancing their political agenda. Features stories like "Trump Thinks Hillary Used Chemicals On Her Emails", but also has been recognized by Time magazing as top political blog: http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1879276_1879279_1879298,00.html	2

dailykos.com	Yellow	Yellow		Yellow	Low quality partisan journalism. The site features sensationalist headlines, but mostly factual reporting with minor inaccuracies.	1
dailymail.co.uk	Yellow	Yellow		Yellow	Low quality journalism (Example article title: "Pack(er)ing it on! James and ex Mariah ditch diets!" and "Could Swiss CHEESE be a superfood? It contains a probiotic that could help you live longer, claim scientists"). The site is a prime example of a tabloid with sensationalist headline and little sourcing. The most severe falsehood around politics were shared by other sources (http://www.snopes.com/isis-killing-babies-syndrome/ , http://www.snopes.com/2017/04/12/daily-mail-melania-trump-libel/), which is consistent with the inaccurate and overreaching titles of the site but not fabricated.	3
dailynewsbin.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	Political fabrications and conspiracy theorist site. (Example article title: "Donald Trumps donation to louisiana-flood-victims-actually-went-to-an-anti-gay-hate-groups", and "Ben Carson is almost certainly suffering from a mental illness")	1

dailywire.com	Red	Yellow		Orange	Partisan articles, and low quality journalism. (Example article title: "Peak 2017: Math Is Now Racist " and "Fat Feminists Are NOT Going To Like This Study".)	3
dallasnews.com	Green	Yellow		Green	Trusted source by Snopes with only a single minor inaccuracy. Has a place to report suggested corrections, but no apparent place where corrections can easily be found.	1
davidwolfe.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	Pseudoscience site promoting alteranative medicine that have made several outragious false claims, but not in the domain of politics	3
dcclothesline.com	Red	Red		Red	Promotes hyper-partisan agenda through conspiracy theory stories with little regard for facts; Current articles on this site include headlines like "BUSTED: Parents Catch FBI in Plot to Force Mentally Ill Son to Be a Right Wing Terrorist." There is no attempt to provide quality sources and in the Snopes case, its pretty easy to tell whether or not a tweet is real	1
deadstate.org	Orange	Yellow	Yellow	Yellow	The link on Snopes, and also the fact that this is basically one guy, makes it clear the editorial process is marginal. But there's limited sensationalism here from what I can tell	1
defund.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	A blog that promotes extreme-right agenda with sensationalist headlines, but content is mostly factual.;On the border of Red and Orange, but features stories like https://defund.com/ednathan/2017/08/12/hungry-rats-terrorizing-nyc-babies-mayor-bill-de-blasio-wont-kill-inhumane/ about "rats terrorizing babies in NYC". Over-sensationalist, and only ever repeats claims from the Constervative Tribune, Young Cons and the like. 	1
dennismichaellynch.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	A site that carries extreme right agenda through sensationalism with little evidence to back up its claims; The link on Snopes reveals a basic disinterest in the truth; claims are incendiary and very loosely sourced - e.g. "http://dennismichaellynch.com/state-use-400k-taxpayers-study-lgbtq-community-gets-drunk/"	1

ebay.com	N/A	N/A		N/A	Not a news site, e-commerce.	2
endoftheamericandream.com	Orange	Red		Orange	Snopes describes this site as "apocalypse-centric blog". However, this site also doubles in religiously-charged falsehoods and distorted half-truths. Titles like: "ISIS ‘Hit Squads’ Are Using The Refugee Program To Infiltrate Western Nations", "Is Barack Obama Attempting To Harass And Intimidate Media Personalities On His ‘Enemies List’?", "We Have Entered A Time When Islamic Terrorists Will Be Specifically Targeting Christians And Churches In America"	1

eutimes.net	Red	Red		Red	Conspiracy theory and little regard for the truth.	1
express.co.uk	Orange	Orange		Orange	Express is a tabloid, and the three Snopes examples reveal an extreme carelessness and a clear lack of journalistic integrity. The corrections and clarifications are only useful when deliberate attempts to decieve are not made. Due to lack of political orientation we didn't label as Red. 	3
facebook.com	N/A	N/A		N/A	Not a news site. Social media.	3

foxnews.com	Green	Green		Green	Fox news is a reputable news organization, offers retractions and corrections when found false.	1
freewoodpost.com	Satire	Satire		Satire	This is a satire site with clear disclaimer about it and over-the-top content that make it relatively easy to spot identify it as satire.	1
frontpagemag.com	Red	Orange		Red	The site features islamophbic and conspiratory theory stories that have very little evidence behind them, but not 100% fabrications. Has people who appear to have some journalist cRedentials, but clickbait at worst from multiple links, including this one, which disputes the fake news story about General Pershing "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/267622/general-pershing-pigs-philippines-and-islamic-daniel-Greenfield";	1
fury.news	Red	Red		Red	In the TOS: "Fury News has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its Internet web site and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site."  If you're not reviewing everything on your site, what are you doing?  Also has headlines that don't match the story, like "Obama Removed From Private Club After Repulsed Members Notice The Sick Thing He Did", and "http://www.fury.news/2017/01/obama-caught-final-act-treason-secretly-funneling-10-billion-gold-cash-terrorists/".

gotnews.com	Red	Orange		Red	Fabricates stories and twists facts to promote political agenda and advance its trolling of politicians and media personal.; Extremely sensationalist - for example, here taking the words "the government is going to kill this guy", spoken metaphorically, and running the headline  "Martial Law Now". http://gotnews.com/martial-law-now-former-mueller-deputy-phil-mudd-says-deepstate-will-kill-realdonaldtrump-on-cnn/.   They also appear linked to the Seth Rich conspiracy story. However, few things on the site appear to be outright false, suggesting the site is largely overinterpreting events.	2
healthnutnews.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	Pseudoscience alt-medicine site that promotes consipiracy theory about alt-medicine doctors disappearing and anti-vaccination. It's reporting on politics is based on wide range of source, and during the election seems questionably factual, therefore put as Orange. 	3
heatst.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	Anti-elites site that features hateful stories (see addtional comments) with little evidence to back them up. 	1
hellochristian.com	Orange	Yellow		Yellow	The site has unique views on a variety of topics, mostly related to the apocolypse. But their reporting in the political domain is mostly a reasonable interpretation of content from, e.g., the NYT. I can't see the site contributing strongly to the spread of damning fake information	1
hillaryspeeches.com	N/A	N/A 		N/A 	Not a news site	1

impulsetoday.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	Is a one-person blog that promoted the election of Trump up till April 2016 and then continued in 2017.  Stories are questionable (see additional comments) and sourced from untrusted sources.	1
independent.co.uk	Green	Green		Green	A single (minor) inaccuracy documented in Snopes and mostly sober and sourced journalism.	1
infowars.com	Red	Orange		Red	Major propagator of some of the most widespread political falsehoods (e.g. pizzagate, Sandy Hook denial) and conspiracy theories ("GOVERNMENT INSIDER: BUSH AUTHORIZED 911 ATTACKS", "NEW OBAMA BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS A FORGERY"). Regularly republishes articles from dubious sources that promote its political agenda with little regard for the truth. ; InfoWars is a conspiracy website, see, for example, these other links (http://www.snopes.com/obama-army-anti-trump-activists/, http://www.snopes.com/hillary-clinton-has-parkinsons-disease/,https://www.infowars.com/breathtaking-democrats-accused-of-hiring-actors-prior-to-charlottesville-rally/). However, while there is some purely "fake news" in the midst, most content is based ondeceptive interpretations of the truth	3
inquisitr.com	Orange	Yellow		Orange	The site publishes content from around the web with little vetting and editorial process that propgated some major (non-political) falsehoods in the past (see additional checks). However, the falsehoods are not political in essense and thus classified as Orange.	1
instagram.com	N/A	N/A		N/A	Not a news site, image sharing service.	1
iotwreport.com	Orange	Orange		Orange	Promotes falsehoods from other untrusted sources to promote its partisan agenda with little regard for facts (appealing to hate and islamphobia)	1

jookos.com	Red	Red		Red	The site appears to no longer produce content, but had absurd articles like the following : http://www.jookos.com/2017/06/06/british-muslims-now-demanding-queen-convert-islam-leave-country-want-buckingham-palace-turned-mosque/, http://www.jookos.com/2017/05/26/cover-seth-richs-family-says-dnc-assigned-lawyer-connected-george-soros-groups-represent-no-clue/). In addition to 100% fake story documented by Snopes, carried stories like "BREAKING: DOJ Sources say Hillary Clinton will be CHARGED FOR MURDER of DNC Staffer Seth Rich", which together with the conspiracy-driven cover shows little regard for truth.	1
judicialwatch.org	Red	Red		Red	This site is particularly dangerous, given their attempt to claim authority by suggesting they are advocates within the legal system. This mix of authority signals and fake/unsourced news is what led to a Red signal. Recognized by multiple trusted fact-checking organizations as false.	1
lawofficer.com	Yellow	Green		Green	Appears to be a reputable website for Law Enforcement news; the Snopes "mostly false" claim is pretty overblown/nitpicky	1
legacy.com	N/A	N/A		N/A	It does host news stories (obituaries), but writes little content itself.	1
lifenews.com	Green	Yellow		Yellow	Articles are very thinly sourced and the Snopes article shows a disinterest in any vetting of sources considered to be "partisan", which includes, from other articles, things like WaPo. Perhaps most damning is a link to the discredited videos about PP selling babies for parts - http://www.lifenews.com/2015/08/13/washington-post-calls-claim-that-abortion-is-3-of-what-planned-parenthood-does-a-big-lie/ .  Or, this interpretation of Apple donating to SPLC:  http://www.lifenews.com/2017/08/21/apple-will-donate-1-million-to-pro-abortion-group/ . Still, I would consider these reinterpretations, rather than pure deception	1
lifesitenews.com	Yellow	Orange		Yellow	Clickbaity, strong agenda. Has had some spats with both snopes (which calls it "a known purveyor of misleading information") and politifact (e.g., https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/fact-check-of-hillary-clintons-support-for-day-of-birth-abortions-shows-bia), but they seem like errors that could slip in given the difference in worldviews.	2
