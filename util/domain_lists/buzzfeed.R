# Methodology: they used their own previous lists & database, plus Politifact's April 2017 list. From Politifact, only took sites that, as determined by 2 Buzzfeed reviewers,
# "consistently publish completely false stories." Main text of article is even stronger: "websites that entirely or consistently publish articles with a completely false central claim."
# "We also compared our 2016 site list to PolitiFactâ€™s list of websites, and found seven sites that would have qualified for our 2016 list had we known about them at the time."
#   <-- which implies, I think, that the rest of the 2017 list wasn't around in 2016.
